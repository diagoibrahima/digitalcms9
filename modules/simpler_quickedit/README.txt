INTRODUCTION
------------

Do you want to provide users with quickedit - 
but find the core quickedit really unintuitive and providing a bad experience
 (clicking on contextual link, then quick edit, then finally the field you want 
 to edit)?

This modules has 3 goals:
<ol>
  <li>select which fields are quickeditable (with core it's all or none)</li>
  <li>allow the admin to set how to trigger the quickedit</li>
  <li>remove the need to give the contextual link permission</li>
</ol>

Any feedback welcome!

field.
